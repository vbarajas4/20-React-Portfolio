                you never stop learning and you are constantly improving and learning from others. 
                Being able to work both in collaborating groups and independantly is very important 
                in any field, but even more when working with other developers.

                I seek a career in which I can apply the skills I've learned in my study of 
                full-stack web development, and to become an asset to the company in which 
                I will collaborate with and continue to grow.
